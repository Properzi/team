An Effective Positivstellensatz over the Rational Numbers for Finite Semialgebraic Sets

Abstract

I will present recent joint results with Lorenzo Baldi and Bernard Mourrain, on the exact representation of multivariate integer polynomials that are nonnegative on finite semialgebraic sets, described by means of a zero-dimensional ideal, as sums of squares of rational polynomials. We provide existential results for the strictly positive case and a sufficient condition for the nonnegative case, and degree and height (i.e. bit-size) bounds.

Some problems in Hopf-Galois theory

Abstract

Hopf-Galois theory gives a Galois theory for more general field (and even ring) extensions, where one now lets a Hopf algebra play the role of the Galois group. In the case that the extensions involved are separable (but not necessarily normal), the problem of finding Hopf-Galois structures (the analogue of the Galois group) can be approached entirely group theoretically.
This talk will begin by exploring some basic definitions, examples and results that link Hopf-Galois structures on separable extensions to transitive subgroups of the holomorph. I will then present some recent results which involve different ways to classify and study these structures using group theory. Finally, we will discuss a few problems that I am currently interested in, focusing in particular on the connection between Hopf-Galois structures and skew braces.
The talk will be self-contained, so no need to brush-up on any of the specific terms mentioned above!
