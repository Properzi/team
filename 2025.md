Idempotents in quandle rings

Abstract: Quandles are non-associative algebraic structures that arise from the algebraic formulation of the Reidemeister moves of planar diagrams of knots and links in the 3-sphere. Along with their weaker counterparts called racks, quandles also provide bijective non-degenerate set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation. Beyond knot theory, these structures appear in a diverse spectrum of mathematics including surface theory, Riemannian symmetric spaces, Lie algebras and groups. Quandle rings, introduced as analogues of group rings, aim to incorporate ring-theoretic techniques into the study of quandles. Just as group elements serve as units in a group ring, the elements of a quandle act as idempotents in a quandle ring. In this talk, we will investigate the idempotents in quandle rings and their connection to quandle coverings. We will show that integral quandle rings of finite-type quandles, which are non-trivial coverings over well-behaved base quandles, possess infinitely many non-trivial idempotents, and provide a complete characterization of these idempotents. Furthermore, we show that integral quandle rings of free quandles contain only trivial idempotents, thereby identifying an infinite family of quandles with this property. If time permits, we will discuss the application of these idempotents to knot theory.

An Effective Positivstellensatz over the Rational Numbers for Finite Semialgebraic Sets

Abstract

I will present recent joint results with Lorenzo Baldi and Bernard Mourrain, on the exact representation of multivariate integer polynomials that are nonnegative on finite semialgebraic sets, described by means of a zero-dimensional ideal, as sums of squares of rational polynomials. We provide existential results for the strictly positive case and a sufficient condition for the nonnegative case, and degree and height (i.e. bit-size) bounds.

Some problems in Hopf-Galois theory

Abstract

Hopf-Galois theory gives a Galois theory for more general field (and even ring) extensions, where one now lets a Hopf algebra play the role of the Galois group. In the case that the extensions involved are separable (but not necessarily normal), the problem of finding Hopf-Galois structures (the analogue of the Galois group) can be approached entirely group theoretically.
This talk will begin by exploring some basic definitions, examples and results that link Hopf-Galois structures on separable extensions to transitive subgroups of the holomorph. I will then present some recent results which involve different ways to classify and study these structures using group theory. Finally, we will discuss a few problems that I am currently interested in, focusing in particular on the connection between Hopf-Galois structures and skew braces.
The talk will be self-contained, so no need to brush-up on any of the specific terms mentioned above!
