Ilaria Colazzo  
Combinatorial solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and applications

Abstract

The first part of the talk will connect the topological problem of 
distinguishing mathematical knots with combinatorial solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. 
The second one will be devoted to a new algebraic structure (skew braces) 
that provides the perfect tool to study and classify such solutions.

Andrew Darlington (Exeter)  
Things to see and do with subgroups of the holomorph  

Abstract  

This talk will begin by introducing skew braces and Hopf-Galois structures on Galois extensions, followed by exploring the connection between them. On the Hopf-Galois side, it’s possible to not only look at regular subgroups of the holomorph, but also the more general notion of transitive subgroups, which now correspond with separable extensions (where they don’t necessarily have to be normal). This generalisation leads to a number of very interesting questions that we can ask, some of which will be covered in the second half of the talk.

Raúl Sastriques (Valencia)  
Decomposability theorems for the YBE

Abstract

In relation to the Garside groups, we find the Yang-Baxter equation, 
which provides a family of Garside groups of great interest. 
The purpose of the talk will be to explain the relation between the two 
structures established by F. Chouraqui, as well as our latest results, 
regarding certain arithmetic properties, which provide new criteria 
for the decomposability of these type of solutions.
